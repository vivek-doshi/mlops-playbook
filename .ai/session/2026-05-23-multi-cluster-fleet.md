- Fleet golden path documentation.
- Getting started routing update.
- ADR extension for 2026 fleet decision.

## Files Added

- `cd/fleet-overlays/production/.gitkeep`
- `cd/fleet-overlays/dev/.gitkeep`
- `cd/fleet-overlays/staging/webapp-example/kustomization.yaml`
- `policy/kyverno/fleet-policy-propagation.yaml`
- `observability/prometheus/fleet-aggregation.yaml`
- `docs/golden-paths/multi-cluster-fleet.md`

## Files Updated

- `observability/prometheus/values.yaml` (commented `remoteWrite` upgrade-path block)
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` (new multi-cluster fleet row)
- `docs/decisions/ADR-003-gitops-strategy.md` (2026 fleet extension section)

## Validation

- YAML parse check passed for all newly added fleet YAML files:
  - `cluster-registry.yaml`
  - `fleet-project.yaml`
  - `fleet-applicationset.yaml`
  - `fleet-workload-applicationset.yaml`
  - `fleet-policy-propagation.yaml`
  - `fleet-aggregation.yaml`

## Notes

- Fixed Go-template YAML quoting in `fleet-workload-applicationset.yaml` to keep parser compatibility.
