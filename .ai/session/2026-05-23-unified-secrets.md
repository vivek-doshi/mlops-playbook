# Session Summary - 2026-05-23 - Unified Secrets

## Objective

Unify fragmented secrets documentation into a single entry point under `secrets/` while preserving existing YAML templates and references.

## Changes Completed

- Created unified top-level secrets entry point:
  - `secrets/README.md`
- Added lifecycle and runbook guides:
  - `secrets/guides/secret-lifecycle.md`
  - `secrets/guides/emergency-rotation.md`
  - `secrets/guides/secret-offboarding.md`
- Updated strategic secrets guide with top navigation section:
  - `docs/guides/secrets-management.md`
- Updated getting started index with a dedicated secrets section:
  - `GETTING_STARTED.md`

## Constraints Honored

- Did not modify files in `secrets/external-secrets/`.
- Did not modify files in `secrets/rotation/`.
- Used canonical secret naming convention `/service-name/environment/secret-name` in examples.
- Avoided real secret values and used placeholders only.

## Notes

- `secrets/` is currently ignored by `.gitignore`, so newly created files under `secrets/` may not appear in default `git status` output for commit unless ignore rules are adjusted.
